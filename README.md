## Welcome to my code!
My name is Robert Sharp but everyone calls me Broken, ironic because I tend to fix everything I touch. I have been programming since I was seven years old and I have an unending passion for learning new technologies. For me, programming is not a job or career path, but a lifestyle. It's something I have to do because it is who I am. Over the years, I have learned more than a dozen programming languages, but Python is my jam.
