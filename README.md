## Greetings!
My name is Robert Sharp. I'm a software engineer with several decades of experience. I've been programming all my life, I started when I was 6 years old on a retired mainframe running Unix. Spanning 30+ years - I've learned, used and forgotten over a dozen programming languages. But my true passion is for teaching advanced Python. I have experience with C++, Fortran, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. I like to learn at least one new language every year, but I don't get too caught up with the flavor (framework) of the month. I've seen many technologies come and go, and that's the nature of our industry.
